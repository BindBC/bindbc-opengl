# bindbc-opengl
This project provides dynamic bindings to [the OpenGL library](https://www.opengl.org/). It supports OpenGL versions up to and including 4.6, along with numerous extensions (if an extension you need is not yet supported, please submit a PR or open an issue). `bindbc-opengl` is compatible with `@nogc` and `nothrow`, and can be compiled with `-betterC` compatibility. This package is intended as a replacement of [DerelictGL3](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictGL3), which does not provide the same level of compatibility.

__Note that `bindbc-gl` currently does not support deprecated OpenGL features.__

## Add `bindbc-opengl` to your project
By default, `bindbc-opengl` is configured to compile with `-betterC` compatibility disabled, and with support only for up to OpenGL 2.1 core. To use `-bindbc-opengl` in this default mode, simply add the package as a dependency in your `dub.json` or `dub.sdl` package description:

__dub.json__
```
"dependencies": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "~>0.13.0"
}
```

__dub.sdl__
```
dependency "bindbc-opengl" version="~>0.13.0"
```

## Enable `-betterC` support
To enable support for `-betterC` mode, add the `dynamicBC` subconfiguration to your package description file:

__dub.json__
```
"dependencies": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "~>0.13.0"
}
"subConfigurations": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "dynamicBC"
},
```

__dub.sdl__
```
dependency "bindbc-opengl" version="~>0.13.0"
subConfiguration "bindbc-opengl" "dynamicBC"
```

## Enable support for OpenGL versions 3.0 and higher
Support for OpenGL versions can be configured at compile time by adding the appropriate version to a `versions` directive in your package configuration file (or on the command line if you are building with a tool other than dub).

`bindbc-opengl` defines a D version identifier for each OpenGL version. The following table lists each identifier and the OpenGL versions they enable.

| OpenGL Version  | Version ID     |
|-----------------|----------------|
|1.0 - 2.1        | Default        |
|1.0 - 3.0        | GL_30          |
|1.0 - 3.1        | GL_31          |
|1.0 - 3.2        | GL_32          |
|1.0 - 3.3        | GL_33          |
|1.0 - 4.0        | GL_40          |
|1.0 - 4.1        | GL_41          |
|1.0 - 4.2        | GL_42          |
|1.0 - 4.3        | GL_43          |
|1.0 - 4.4        | GL_44          |
|1.0 - 4.5        | GL_45          |
|1.0 - 4.6        | GL_46          |

Adding one of these version identifiers to your package description will do two things:

* symbols for the core OpenGL types and functions for the supported OpenGL versions will be declared and available in user code
* the `loadOpenGL` function will attempt to load all OpenGL versions for which support is enabled and which is supported by the OpenGL context at runtime.

To load all functions and enable all constants from "classic" OpenGL versions, i.e. those that have been deprecated, set the version identifier `GL_AllowDeprecated`
in your build system.

The following examples are configured to load core functions from all OpenGL versions up to OpenGL 4.1:


__dub.json__
```
"dependencies": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "~>0.13.0"
}
"versions": [
    "GL_41"
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```
dependency "bindbc-opengl" version="~>0.13.0"
versions "GL_41"
```

With this configuration, client code can make use of all core OpenGL types and functions up to OpenGL 4.1. At runtime, if the context supports OpenGL 4.1 or higher, the loader will attempt to load up to OpenGL 4.1. If the highest OpenGL version the context supports is lower than 4.1, the loader will attempt to load up to that version.

To enable the loading of deprecated functions in the same configuration:

__dub.json__
```
"dependencies": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "~>0.13.0"
}
"versions": [
    "GL_41", "GL_AllowDeprecated
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```
dependency "bindbc-opengl" version="~>0.13.0"
versions "GL_41" "GL_AllowDeprecated"
```

With this, all OpenGL functions, both core and deprecated, will be loaded. `GL_AllowDeprecated` by itself enables support for  functions and constants that were deprecated in OpenGL
versions 1.0 - 1.4, and constants which were deprecated in versions 2.0 and 2.1. When `GL_AllowDeprecated` is specified in conjunction with `GL_30` or higher, support for deprecated
constants from OpenGL version 3.0 will be enabled.

## Enable support for extensions
Extension support is added primarily on an as needed basis. All supported ARB/KHR extensions can be enabled by adding the `GL_ARB` version identifier to your `dub.json` or `dub.sdl`.

For example, the following enables support for all core OpenGL functions up to and including GL 4.1, as well as all ARB/KHR extensions.

__dub.json__
```
"dependencies": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "~>0.13.0"
}
"versions": [
    "GL_41",
    "GL_ARB"
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```
dependency "bindbc-opengl" version="~>0.13.0"
versions "GL_41" "GL_ARB"
```

Extensions which were promoted to the core OpenGL API are loaded automatically as part of the OpenGL versions to which they belong.

Specific extensions can be enabled using the extension's OpenGL name string as a version identifier. The name string for each extension [is listed in the `bindbc-opengl` wiki](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-opengl/wiki/Supported-Extensions). It takes the form of `GL_` prefixed to the extension name.

For example, the following configurations enable support for OpenGL 4.1 and the extensions `ARB_base_instance` and `ARB_compressed_texture_pixel_storage` (both of which were promoted to core in OpenGL 4.2).

__dub.json__
```
"dependencies": {
    "bindbc-opengl": "~>0.13.0"
}
"versions": [
    "GL_41",
    "GL_ARB_base_instance",
    "GL_ARB_compressed_texture_pixel_storage"
],
```

__dub.sdl__
```
dependency "bindbc-opengl" version="~>0.13.0"
versions "GL_41" "GL_ARB_base_instance" "GL_ARB_compressed_texture_pixel_storage"
```

The `loadOpenGL` function (described in the next section) will attempt to load all extensions configured in this manner. No errors will be reported on failure. To determine if an extension was loaded, use the `hasARBFoo` property for each extension, like so:

```d
import bindbc.opengl;

// Create the OpenGL context and load OpenGl
...
// Check for required extensions
if(hasARBBaseInstance) {
    // configure renderer for GL_ARB_base_instance support
}
if(hasARBCompressedTexturePixelStorage) {
    // configure renderer for
    // GL_ARB_compressed_texture_pixel_storage support
}
```

All supported extensions [are listed at the `bindbc-opengl` wiki](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-opengl/wiki/Supported-Extensions). Support for more extensions is added on an ongoing, as-needed basis. If you have a need for an extension that is not currently supported, [please file and issue](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-opengl/issues).

## Loading OpenGL
The `loadOpenGL` function is used to load all supported OpenGL functions and extensions. In order for this function to succeed, an OpenGL context must be created before it is called. The return value of `loadOpenGL` can be used to determine which version of OpenGL actually loaded.

For example, assume you've configured `bindbc-opengl` to support up to OpenGL 4.1, but you've designed your renderer to work with both 4.1 and 3.3. You can create a 4.1 or 3.3 context in one part of your code, then load OpenGL in another part, and configure your renderer based upon the return value.

```d
import bindbc.opengl;

// Create OpenGL context
...
// Load supported OpenGL version + supported extensions
GLSupport retVal = loadOpenGL();
if(retVal == GLSupport.gl41) {
    // configure renderer for OpenGL 4.1
}
else if(retVal == GLSupport.gl33) {
    // configure renderer for OpenGL 3.3
}
else {
    // Error
}
```

On error, `loadOpenGL` will return one of the following:
* `GLSupport.noLibrary` - the OpenGL shared library failed to load
* `GLSupport.badLibrary` - one of the context-independent symbols (OpenGL 1.0 & 1.1) in the OpenGL shared library failed to load.
* `GLSupport.noContext` - an OpenGL context was not created before calling the function.

The following functions are provided for convenience:
* `isOpenGLLoaded` - returns `true` if any version of OpenGL has been successfully loaded and `false` otherwise.
* `openGLContextVersion` - returns a `GLSupport` member corresponding to the version supported by the OpenGL context against which the library was loaded.
* `loadedOpenGLVersion` - returns a `GLSupport` member corresponding to the version of OpenGL currently loaded (identical to the return value of `loadOpenGL`).

Note that when working with multiple contexts, it may be necessary to call `loadOpenGL` on every context switch. On Windows in particular, a context switch may cause context-dependent functions (i.e, core functions above 1.1 and all extensions) to become invalid in some circumstances.

See [the README for `bindbc.loader`](https://github.com/BindBC/bindbc-loader/blob/master/README.md) for the error handling API.
